## Decisions Made

- Keep demo/Docs exports out of the root UI barrel; expose via `@chatui/ui/dev`
- Require React 19 for `@chatui/ui` to align with Apps SDK UI usage
- Release workflow standardized via Changesets + CI action
- CI runs lint, format check, compliance, type-checks, unit tests, and builds
- Unit tests use jsdom environment with mocked Radix dependencies
- Tests focus on invariants (render, ref, disabled, keyboard, ARIA) not visual appearance
- New widgets demonstrate key Apps SDK patterns: widgetSessionId, multi-view navigation, auth flows
- Widget-only tools (auth_logout, auth_refresh) use `visibility: "private"` to hide from model
- i18n uses lightweight custom utility instead of react-intl (simpler, smaller bundle)
- Template URIs versioned via query param for cache busting without filename changes
- Bundle size budget set at 500KB warning (not hard fail) to allow flexibility
- Widgets should prefer Apps SDK UI token utilities over manual light/dark branching
