- Scope: System architecture and component relationships
- Non-scope: Step-by-step operational procedures
- Owner: TBD (confirm)
- Review cadence: TBD (confirm)

## Tokens are the single source of truth

All UI styling (React + widgets) is driven from one canonical DTCG token bundle:

- Canonical: `packages/tokens/src/tokens/index.dtcg.json`
- Generated web: `packages/ui/src/styles/ui.css`, `packages/ui/src/styles/theme.css` (imports `@astudio/tokens/tokens.css`)
- Token reference (authoritative mapping): `docs/theming/token-reference.md`

### Drift prevention

- No hard-coded styling literals in components (except documented escape hatches).
- Generated artifacts are committed and CI-regenerated and diff-checked.
- Any new component state requires token coverage (default/pressed/focus/disabled; hover where applicable).
