**Last updated:** 2026-01-24  
**Scope:** Explain top-level directories and which are canonical vs auxiliary.

## Canonical

- `apps/` — navigation index only (canonical apps live under `platforms/`).
- `platforms/` — canonical platform apps and MCP server.
- `packages/` — reusable packages (ui, tokens, runtime, widgets, etc.).
- `docs/` — documentation and audits.
- `scripts/` — build, compliance, and automation scripts.

## Auxiliary / Tools

- `brand/` — brand assets.
- `references/` — reference materials.
- `_tools/` — local tooling helpers.
- `_temp/` — temporary working files (not canonical).
- `ai/` — AI artifacts or helpers.
- `audit/` — audit outputs (non-canonical, historical).
- `codex/` — Codex integration data.
- `.spec/` — archived specs and review artifacts.
