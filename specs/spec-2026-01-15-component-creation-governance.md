# PRD: aStudio Component Creation Governance

**Owner:** Jamie Scott Craik (@jscraik)  
**Status:** Draft  
**Last updated:** 2026-01-15  
**Stakeholders:** Jamie (solo dev)  
**Links:** .spec/PROJECT_REVIEW_REPORT.md | docs/architecture/ui-structure-map.md | docs/guides/UI_COMPONENT_TOOLING.md | docs/architecture/cross-platform-design.md | docs/architecture/repo-map.md

> Rule: If a section is not applicable, write `N/A` and explain why in 1–2 lines.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] A single component creation guide exists at `docs/guides/COMPONENT_CREATION.md` and covers React + Apps SDK UI surfaces, tokens, tests, and release steps in one place.
- [ ] Coverage checklist source-of-truth is `docs/design-system/COVERAGE_MATRIX.md` (generated) and is linked from the component guide; updates are required on new component PRs.
- [ ] Guide and checklist ownership, review cadence, and definition-of-done linkage are documented in `docs/guides/COMPONENT_CREATION.md`.
- [ ] A required UX state taxonomy is documented with validation steps (see Section 5.1).
- [ ] Accessibility checks are documented and required for new components with a manual audit cadence and evidence artifact (see Section 6.3).
- [ ] Definition of done includes coverage updates, UX states, test evidence, and release verification steps (see Section 6.1).
- [ ] MCP tool contract source-of-truth location is documented and referenced in `docs/operations/RUNBOOK.md`.
- [ ] Rollback steps for MCP + widgets are documented in `docs/operations/RUNBOOK.md`.
- [ ] Telemetry events are defined for widget renders and MCP tool calls, with target KPIs and data governance (see Section 6.2).
- [ ] SLO targets and error budget policy are documented in `docs/operations/SLOS.md`.
- [ ] MCP tool contracts are validated in CI and referenced in release checks (implementation details in Tech Spec).

## 0) PRD Summary

- **One-liner:** A single, repeatable component-creation workflow and consistency governance process for Jamie to build consistent React + Apps SDK UI components quickly.
- **Why now:** Current guidance is scattered and surface coverage is partial; the solo workflow needs standardization to cut component delivery time.
- **Desired outcome:** Reduce median time-to-ship for new components from ~48 hours to ≤ 2 hours while improving UI consistency and coverage tracking.

---

## 1) Executive Summary

Jamie is building a design-system-first UI workbench across React and Apps SDK UI surfaces. Today, component creation is slowed by scattered guidance and partial coverage across surfaces. This PRD defines a unified component creation workflow and consistency governance that allows a solo developer to ship components faster without sacrificing consistency or accessibility.

The change introduces a single source of truth for “how to create a component,” explicit coverage tracking, and measurable quality gates for UX states, accessibility, and consistency. Success will be measured by reduced time-to-ship, fewer visual regressions, and higher surface coverage. This PRD does not introduce new product features for end users; it focuses on developer productivity and quality.

Out of scope are non-UI backend services, unrelated product features, and any redesign of Apps SDK UI foundations. Technical implementation details are captured in the accompanying Tech Spec.

---

## 2) Problem Statement / Opportunity

### 2.1 Problem

- **Who is affected:** Jamie (solo developer maintaining aStudio’s UI system)
- **Pain today:** Component creation requires hopping across multiple docs; coverage decisions are inconsistent and time-consuming.
- **Current workaround:** Manual search across guides and architecture docs; ad-hoc coverage decisions.
- **Impact if we do nothing:** Component delivery stays slow (~48 hours), coverage gaps grow, and UI inconsistencies persist.

### 2.2 Evidence (required)

- Baseline median time-to-ship per component: ~48 hours (solo dev estimate).
- Surface coverage documentation shows core React components complete while widget and desktop usage still lags.
- Guidance is scattered across multiple docs with no single “end-to-end” workflow.

### 2.3 Opportunity

- **What improves if solved:** Faster component delivery, fewer UI regressions, and a clear coverage roadmap.
- **Why we’re well-positioned:** Existing architecture, tooling (`pnpm new:component`), and coverage docs can be unified into a single workflow.

## 3) Target Users / Personas

> Personas must be specific. Each persona should have real context + pain.

| Persona | Role              | Context                                        | Goals                           | Pain points                                 |
| ------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Jamie   | Solo UI developer | Builds components across React + Apps SDK UI   | Ship components quickly         | Scattered guidance, unclear surface coverage |

**Primary user(s):** Jamie (solo dev)  
**Secondary user(s):** N/A — single-user project.

- **Use case B:** Jamie updates a component → uses the checklist to ensure no UX state regression → runs required tests → releases confidently.
- **Use case C:** Jamie ships a widget update → runs contract validation + widget checks → confirms telemetry baseline → releases.

## 5) Functional Requirements

### Journey: Component creation

- FR-1: Provide a single, end-to-end component creation guide. (Priority: Must)
- FR-2: Include coverage checklist and update workflow. (Priority: Must)
- FR-3: Document UX state requirements and validation steps. (Priority: Must)
- FR-4: Define a clear “definition of done” for component releases. (Priority: Should)

### Edge cases & failure UX (required)

- If a component lacks a widget or desktop usage example, the guide defines how to record the coverage gap.
- If a component lacks required UX states, the guide blocks release until states are defined.
- If accessibility checks fail, the guide requires remediation before release.

### 5.1 UX State Taxonomy (required)

Minimum required states per component:

- Initial loading (skeleton or spinner, defined by component)
- Background refresh / stale data
- Empty state with next action (if applicable)
- No-results state (for search/filter contexts)
- Error state with recovery path (retry, fallback, or contact)
- Permission/entitlement denied (if applicable)
- Offline or degraded mode (if applicable)
- Success confirmation (for action components)

Validation evidence must be captured in component stories or test artifacts (see Section 6.1).
---

## 6) Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** N/A — documentation-only change; performance budgets are defined in Tech Spec.
- **Reliability:** The guidance must be stable and versioned with the repo.
- **Security & privacy:** No sensitive data; ensure no secrets are embedded in docs.
- **Compliance:** N/A — no regulated data.
- **Accessibility:** WCAG 2.2 AA baseline for component guidance.
- **Observability expectation:** Track component creation time and regressions via repo metrics and CI reports.

### 6.1 Governance & Definition of Done (required)

- **Owner:** Jamie (primary); **Backup owner:** TBD (record in guide when available).
- **Review cadence:** every release or monthly (whichever is sooner).
- **Gate:** PR template and release checklist must include DoD checklist; missing items block release.
- **Definition of Done checklist (minimum):**
  - Component guide updated or referenced
  - Coverage matrix updated (or gap recorded)
  - UX state stories or test artifacts exist for required states
  - Accessibility checks complete with audit artifact
  - Release verification steps completed

### 6.2 Telemetry Data Governance (required)

- **Event schema location:** Documented in `docs/operations/RUNBOOK.md` (Telemetry section).
- **Allowed fields:** component name, surface (web/widget/desktop), state, duration bucket, success/failure.
- **Prohibited fields:** user identifiers, raw content, prompts, PII.
- **Retention:** define window and deletion policy in runbook.
- **Access control:** restrict to repo owners; document access list.

### 6.3 Accessibility Verification (required)

- **Automated checks:** keyboard navigation, focus-visible, color contrast, label/name/role/value.
- **Manual audit cadence:** every release; scope limited to new or modified components.
- **Evidence artifact:** store audit checklist output in `docs/operations/` (format defined in guide).
