### Patch Changes

- Add new design tokens (accent-foreground, ring, accent-purple) and migrate all UI components to use foundation design tokens instead of hardcoded values.

  **Design Tokens:**
  - Added `--accent-foreground` token for text on accent-colored backgrounds
  - Added `--accent-purple` token for purple accent color
  - Added `--ring` token for focus ring/keyboard navigation states
  - Updated DTCG source with new `accent.foreground` and `interactive.ring` tokens

  **Component Updates:**
  - Fixed all hardcoded typography values to use foundation tokens (caption, body-small, body, heading-3)
  - Removed hardcoded line-heights and letter-spacing to use token defaults
  - Fixed 40+ UI components across base, navigation, overlays, forms, chat, and settings categories

  **Breaking Changes:**
  None - this is a minor version bump for new tokens and internal improvements
